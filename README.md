# Experis Academy Case: Alumni Network

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
The Experis Academy fullstack developer course with Noroff Accelerate has been run
many times and in many different locations since the programme first began. Both Experis and Noroff have experienced difficulty in maintaining contact with past candidates
to notify them of social events and gather data for quality assurance purposes. With that in mind, This application is developed to facilitate this kind of communication.
